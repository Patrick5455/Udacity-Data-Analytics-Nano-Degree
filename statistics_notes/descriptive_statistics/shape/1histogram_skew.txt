Histograms
We learned how to build a histogram in this video, as this is the most popular visual for quantitative data.

Shape
From a histogram we can quickly identify the shape of our data, which helps influence all of the measures we learned in the previous concepts. We learned that the distribution of our data is frequently associated with one of the three shapes:

1. Right-skewed

2. Left-skewed

3. Symmetric (frequently normally distributed)

Summary
Shape	Mean vs. Median	Real World Applications
Symmetric (Normal)	Mean equals Median	Height, Weight, Errors, Precipitation
Right-skewed	Mean greater than Median	Amount of drug remaining in a blood stream, Time between phone calls at a call center, Time until light bulb dies
Left-skewed	Mean less than Median	Grades as a percentage in many universities, Age of death, Asset price changes
The mode of a distribution is essentially the tallest bar in a histogram. There may be multiple modes depending on the number of peaks in our histogram.
