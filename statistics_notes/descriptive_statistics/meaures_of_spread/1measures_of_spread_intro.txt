Measures of Spread
Measures of Spread are used to provide us an idea of how spread out our data are from one another. Common measures of spread include:

Range
Interquartile Range (IQR)
Standard Deviation
Variance
Throughout this lesson you will learn how to calculate these, as well as why we would use one measure of spread over another.
