Example to Introduce Notation
There is a lot going on in this video - here is a recap of the big ideas.

Rows and Columns
If you aren't familiar with spreadsheets, this will be covered in detail in future lessons. Spreadsheets are a common way to hold data. They are composed of rows and columns. Rows run horizontally, while columns run vertically. Each column in a spreadsheet commonly holds a specific variable, while each row is commonly called an instance or individual.

The example used in the video is shown below.

Date	Day of Week	Time Spent On Site (X)	Buy (Y)
June 15	Thursday	5	No
June 15	Thursday	10	Yes
June 16	Friday	20	Yes
This is a row:

Date	Day of Week	Time Spent On Site (X)	Buy (Y)
June 15	Thursday	5	No
This is a column:

Time Spent On Site (X)
5
10
20
Before Collecting Data
Before collecting data, we usually start with a question, or many questions, that we would like to answer. The purpose of data is to help us in answering these questions.

Random Variables
A random variable is a placeholder for the possible values of some process (mostly... the term 'some process' is a bit ambiguous). As was stated before, notation is useful in that it helps us take complex ideas and simplify (often to a single letter or single symbol). We see random variables represented by capital letters (X, Y, or Z are common ways to represent a random variable).

We might have the random variable X, which is a holder for the possible values of the amount of time someone spends on our site. Or the random variable Y, which is a holder for the possible values of whether or not an individual purchases a product.

X is 'a holder' of the values that could possibly occur for the amount of time spent on our website. Any number from 0 to infinity really.
