nvestment Data
Consider we have two investment opportunities:

Returns			
Year 1	Year 2	Year 3	Year 4	Year 5	Year 6
Investment 1	5%	5%	5%	5%	5%	5%
Investment 2	12%	-2%	10%	0%	7%	3%


Useful Insight
The above example is a simplified version of the real world, but does point out something useful that you may have heard before. 
Notice if you were not fully invested in either Investment 1 or fully invested in Investment 2, 
but instead you were diversified across both investment options, 
you could earn more than either investment individually.
This is the benefit of diversifying your portfolio for long term gains. 
For short term gains, you might not need or want to diversify. 
You could get lucky and hit short term gains associated with the upswings (12%, 10%, or 7%) of Investment 2. 
However, you might also get unlucky, and hit a down term and earn nothing or even lose money on your investment using this same strategy
